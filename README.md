# Food App

> The Food app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a reciape. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them.
